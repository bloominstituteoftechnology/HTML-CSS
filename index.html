			<p>Welcome to my Portfolio page. A little about myself. I have a Masters degree in Biochemistry and Melocular Biology from Fudan University of China. After graduating from Fudan University, my love for Neuroscience brought me to University of Birmingham, UK from where I got my second Masters degree in Neuropsychology. I came to United States after my graduation and live in Bay Area since then.</p>

					<img src="./me.JPG" id="me" />
					<p>After moving to United States, I found a job in the Clinical Department of a Bio-medical Device Company, and worked as Clinical Trial Coordinator for three years. I got a chance to play with coding one day, and surprisingly found out that I did love coding. After receiving the notification from Lambda School, I resigned from my previous job, and became a full-time Web Developer student.</p>
